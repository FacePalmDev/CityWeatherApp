# CityWeather Api

## Things to clarify 
* Does the star rating system accept values like 4.5? I'll assume not for the moment.
* What specific country summary data would the client like to see?

## Why not dotnetcore? 
I wanted to use dotnetcore but was having problems using specflow with it. As there was no requirement
for crossplatform functionality I assumed that the .NET Framework would be fine. 

## Some of your checkins are a little messy!
I know, at one point I got a little tired and started forgetting to check stuff in. It's not pretty and I should really know better.

## PostMan Scripts
I've included some postman scripts to help you test the api. Sure things might need a little tweaking to work on your machine (e.g. port numers etc...).
